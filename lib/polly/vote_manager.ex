  VoteManager is a gen-server responsible for holding and managing votes for a user.
  A VoteManager process holds votes casted by a single user. Each instance is registered
  to the VoteRegistry for fast and convinient discovery and is created under a DynamicSupervisor.

  This process design works well here because the act of "storing a vote" and checking if a user
  has "already cast a vote" are independent operation on a user level.

  The state of the gen server is of the format map(poll_id => %Vote{}). This has been done to provide
  O(1) lookups.
